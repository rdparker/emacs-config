* Configuration Work in Progress

** TODO lsp-mode
** TODO prettier-js
*** TODO Checkout the prettier-js-width-mode configuration variable

** TODO Turn setup.el into a package complete with defcustom properties
* Modes to Investigate

** Generic

*** DONE projectile

** Completion

*** TODO Is it possible to hook into Icicle's completion mechanism?
*** TODO Checkout lsp's presupported mechanisms

** JavaScript

*** TODO js2-mode
*** TODO js3-mode
*** TODO web-mode

If I use this see the prettier-js README for configuring them together.

** DONE add-node-modules-path

This could be hooked into any of the modes that prettier-js is hooked
into so that they use a project's prettier version.

* Packages to Find

** Elisp

*** TODO Find something to autoformat Elisp.
