LispStick! Initialization

Allows you to use a custom [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] configuration and simply call a
function to do what [[http://www.iqool.de/lispstick.html][LispStick!]] normally does at startup in =.emacs=.

Add the following to your Emacs initialization file

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'lispstick)
(lispstick-initialize)
#+END_SRC

to duplicate the LispStick! initialization and launch of [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]] with
[[http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][SLIME]].
