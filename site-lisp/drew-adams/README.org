#+TITLE: Drew Adams' Emacs Configuration and Libraries

I don't use all of these in my own Emacs configuration, but
occasionally I find it fun to play around with his configuration and
look at it for ideas, so there is an =update.sh= BASH script that can
be used to update this directory from his files on [[https://www.emacswiki.org][EmacsWiki]]. The
script is fairly well commented to explain what it does.

Emacs can be started with his init file via by running the following:
=emacs -q -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/drew-adams -l emacs-init.el=.
