;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Extensions to `mouse.el'.
;;
;;  Command `mouse-flash-position' highlights the character after the
;;  mouse pointer position, even as you drag it.  This can help make
;;  it clearer exactly where a `yank' will occur when you use
;;  `mouse-2'.  When you press `mouse-2', if the highlighted position
;;  is not exactly what you want, just keep `mouse-2' held while you
;;  move to the right location.  To enable this behavior, bind
;;  `mouse-flash-position' to `down-mouse-2'.
;;
;;  Command `mouse-flash-position-or-M-x' is the same thing as
;;  `mouse-flash-position', except that it has a special behavior in
;;  the echo area (that is, the minibuffer space when the minibuffer
;;  is inactive).  In the echo area, it calls `M-x'.  To enable this
;;  behavior, bind `mouse-flash-position-or-M-x' to `down-mouse-2'.
;;
;;  Command `mouse-scan-lines' tracks the mouse position, highlighting
;;  the line at that position.  It is handy in buffers like Dired that
;;  are essentially tables with columns - it helps you to align
;;  entries that are in the same row.
;;
;;  Command `mouse-scan-lines-or-M-:' is the same thing as
;;  `mouse-scan-lines', except that it has a special behavior in the
;;  echo area.  In the echo area, it calls `M-:'.  To enable this
;;  behavior, bind `mouse-scan-lines-or-M-:' to `S-down-mouse-2'.
;;
;;  See also library `second-sel.el' for enhancements to
;;  `mouse-drag-secondary' and `mouse-secondary-save-then-kill' that
;;  use a separate ring, `secondary-selection-ring', instead of the
;;  `kill-ring'.
;;
;;
;;  Faces defined here:
;;
;;    `mouse-flash-position', `mouse-scan-lines'.
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `mouse-flash-position', `mouse-flash-position-or-M-x',
;;    `mouse-M-:', `mouse-scan-lines', `mouse-scan-lines-or-M-:'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `mouse-flash-posn-track', `mouse-move-flash-posn-overlay'.
;;
;;  Constants defined here:
;;
;;    `mouse-flash-posn-overlay', `mouse-scan-lines-overlay'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `mouse.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `mouse-drag-region'     - If click echo area and `*Messages*' is
;;                            displayed, do `M-x', delete `*Messages*'
;;  `mouse-tear-off-window' - Don't delete window if it is alone in
;;                            frame.  Instead, clone frame and window.
;;  `mouse-yank-secondary' - Error if (x-get-selection 'SECONDARY)=nil
;;
;;
;;  Do this in your init file (~/.emacs or ~/_emacs):
;;
;;   (require 'mouse+)
;;
;;
;;  Suggested bindings:
;;
;;   The first sexp is NECESSARY for Emacs 24 or later, if you want to
;;   take advantage of the `mouse-drag-region' behavior defined here
;;   wrt buffer `*Messages*' and `M-x'.
;;
;;   ;; Do not use `view-echo-area-messages' for `mouse-1'.   Use
;;   ;; version of `mouse-drag-region' defined here, which does more.
;;   (when (> emacs-major-version 23)

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2016/12/09 dadams
;;     mouse-yank-secondary: x-get-selection -> gui-get-selection for Emacs 25+.
;; 2015/11/22 dadams
;;     mouse-drag-region: Corrected test for mouse-drag-track call to Emacs 25+.
;;     Removed lexical-binding declaration to file.
;; 2015/11/21 dadams
;;     Added lexical-binding declaration to file.  Otherwise, mouse-drag-region no longer
;;       set the region (when mouse-drag-copy-region = t).
;; 2014/07/13 dadams
;;     mouse-drag-region:
;;      Use save-window-excursion instead of trying to restore buffer.
;;      If *Messages* is selected then bury-buffer instead of delete-window.
;;      Mention in Commentary: must remove Emacs 24 binding of view-echo-area-messages.
;; 2014/05/19 dadams
;;     mouse-drag-region: Handle incompatible change for Emacs 24.4+.
;; 2011/12/19 dadams
;;     mouse-scan-lines: Use line-(beginning|end)-position, not (beginning|end)-of-line.
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Removed autoload cookie from non def* sexp.  Added for defface.
;; 2010/10/12 dadams
;;     mouse-flash-position: Updated doc string for Emacs 24.
;; 2009/04/26 dadams
;;     mouse-scan-lines: Bind inhibit-field-text-motion to t, for end-of-line.
;; 2008/09/29 dadams
;;     Added: redefinition of mouse-drag-region.
;; 2008/05/23 dadams
;;     Soft-require second-sel.el.
;;     mouse-yank-secondary: Added prefix arg treatment.
;; 2008/05/02 dadams
;;     (put 'mouse-yank-secondary 'delete-selection 'yank)
;; 2007/01/27 dadams
;;     Added: mouse-scan-lines(-overlay), mouse-scan-lines-or-M-:,
;; 2006/11/04 dadams
;;     Added: mouse-M-:.
;;     mouse-flash-position-or-M-x: Use switch-to-buffer.  Skip minibuffers.
;; 2006/11/03 dadams
;;     Added: mouse-flash-position-or-M-x.
;; 2006/08/12 dadams
;;     mouse-flash-posn-overlay: Added mouse-face to overlay.
;;     mouse-flash-posn-track:
;;       Replaced push with setq...cons, to avoid runtime require of cl.el for Emacs 20.
;; 2006/08/11 dadams
;;     Added: mouse-flash-position (face and command), mouse-flash-posn-overlay,
;;            mouse-flash-posn-track, mouse-move-flash-posn-overlay.
;; 2004/09/28 dadams
;;     Added: mouse-yank-secondary.
