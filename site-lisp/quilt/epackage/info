Description: interactive commands to quilt(1) program
 Provides M-x commands: quilt-push, quilt-push-all, quilt-pop,
 quilt-pop-all, quilt-goto, quilt-top, quilt-find-file,
 quilt-files, quilt-import, quilt-diff, quilt-new, quilt-applied,
 quilt-add, quilt-edit-patch, quilt-patches, quilt-unapplied,
 quilt-refresh, quilt-remove, quilt-edit-series, quilt-mode

 Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes
 each of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack, and you can
 apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the stack
 (push/pop).
 .
 Note: 2011-12-30 the code hasn't been touched since 2005.
