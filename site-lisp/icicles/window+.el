;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Extensions to `window.el'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `window.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `count-windows' -
;;     Only use arg MINIBUF if current frame has a minibuffer.
;;
;;  `special-display-popup-frame' (Emacs 24+) - Fit the frame.
;;
;;  `quit-window' - Call `delete-window' inside `condition-case'.
;;
;;  This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `window.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
;;  (eval-after-load "window" '(require 'window+))
;;

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2014/10/25 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame: Protect set-window-prev-buffers with fboundp.
;; 2014/02/16 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame:
;;       Use vanilla Emacs 24 code for display-buffer-record-window,
;;       set-window-buffer, etc.  Fixes Emacs bug #16768.
;; 2012/10/15 dadams
;;     Do not redefine quit-window for Emacs 24+, so do not delete frame for NEWS.
;;       Thx to Martin Rudalics.
;; 2012/09/10 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame: Protect fit-frame call with fboundp.
;; 2012/08/31 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame:
;;       save-selected-window -> save-window-excursion -
;;         fixes bug that moved point to bob when use pp-eval-last-sexp.
;; 2012/08/25 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame:
;;       Put back missing (set-window-buffer window buffer) - removed accidentally.
;;       Call fit-frame with the buffer's WINDOW selected.  Inhibit before then.
;; 2012/08/11 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame:
;;       Adapt redefinition for all Emacs versions.
;;       Do not raise or fit frame if (car ARGS) is a FUNCTION.  Make it do the work.
;; 2012/08/10 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame: Updated for latest Emacs 24.
;; 2011/06/29 dadams
;;     Added: special-display-popup-frame (for Emacs 24+).
;;     Require fit-frame.el (for Emacs 24+).
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Added autoload cookie for command quit-window.
;; 2008/02/27 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of quit-window.
;; 1996/01/25 dadams
;;     count-windows: Returned to original meaning of arg,
;;                    but only use arg ifframe has a minibuffer.
