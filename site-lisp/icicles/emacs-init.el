;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Emacs init file that uses Drew Adams' Emacs libraries.  This
;;    file and Drew's libraries can be used with GNU Emacs 20, 21, or
;;    22.
;;
;;  You can use this model ~/.emacs as a guide.  It also contains info
;;  on customization options and overriding settings made by my Emacs
;;  Lisp libraries.
;;
;;  Many of my customizations have worked with Emacs versions prior to
;;  20, as well.  I have used them on Windows 9x/NT/XP, GNU/Linux, and
;;  Unix.
;;
;;  This file also provides an introduction to using Emacs - see HELP
;;  WITH EMACS, below.
;;
;;  NOTE: It is usually better to start with vanilla Emacs (an empty
;;  .emacs file) and add things one at a time than it is to start with
;;  a .emacs file from someone else.  If nothing else, it is easier to
;;  debug problems that might arise.  So treat this as a guide only.

;;
;;  INSTALLATION
;;
;;  Make a copy of this file in your home directory, and modify that
;;  as needed.  It can be named `_emacs' or `.emacs'.  It becomes your
;;  initialization file, loaded automatically whenever you start
;;  Emacs.  You can edit this, in order to customize Emacs.  Detailed
;;  instructions for doing so can be found below.
;;
;;    MICROSOFT WINDOWS - It's probably better to use the name
;;    `_emacs' for this file, not `.emacs'.  If you want to use the
;;    name `.emacs', you can use Emacs itself to rename it. (Windows
;;    Explorer won't let you rename the file `.emacs'.)  To rename the
;;    file in Emacs: Visit the directory (via `C-x d') and rename the
;;    file via `r' (`dired-rename-this-file') in the directory buffer.
;;

;;
;;  DREW'S LISP LIBRARY
;;
;;  The Emacs Lisp files in the directory named by the Emacs variable
;;  `drews-lisp-dir' (defined in this file) modify the default
;;  behavior of Emacs considerably.  You might not appreciate every
;;  such customization.
;;
;;  Try getting to know Emacs in the customized form provided here,
;;  before changing things.  You'll find extensive comments in my
;;  source (Emacs Lisp) files that should help you understand how
;;  things work, and how best to change things to suit your needs.
;;  The place to start, in order to understand my code and to change
;;  it, is the rest of the commentary in this file.
;;
;;  The names of my Lisp files follow the following convention.  Files
;;  that replace standard GNU Emacs Lisp files keep their original
;;  names (examples: `appt.el', `delsel.el').  Names of files that are
;;  extensions of standard files are suffixed by `-' or `+', depending
;;  on whether they are to be loaded just before or just after the
;;  corresponding standard files.  For example, my file `compile-.el'
;;  is to be loaded before the standard file `compile.el'.  My file
;;  `compile+.el' is to be loaded after `compile.el'.  The `+' case is
;;  more common than the `-' case.
;;
;;  Some customizations offer more functionality on Unix
;;  platforms.  Some offer more functionality on Windows.  To get the
;;  most out of Emacs on Windows, use it with Cygwin (www.cygwin.com).
;;
;;  Most of my libraries require others to function.  Look for
;;  `(require...)'  and `(load...)'  calls in the source code (*.el
;;  files) to see which other libraries are needed.
;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;;  CUSTOMIZING EMACS
;;
;;  This initialization file modifies basic Emacs in several ways.
;;  You may want to modify it further to suit your own tastes.  Each
;;  of the customizations done here is explained below, together with
;;  how to inhibit it.  The customizations made via libraries loaded
;;  here are explained in those library files themselves; the starting
;;  points are library files `start.el' and `start-opt.el'.
;;
;;  You can always start Emacs with no customizations at all (not even
;;  your `.emacs' file is loaded) via the command line option `-q'.
;;
;;  You need to know the following to customize things further:
;;
;;  1. Initialization files are automatically loaded in this order:
;;     1) A site library, `site-start.el', if there is one.  You can
;;        inhibit this via command line option `-no-site-file' when
;;        starting Emacs.
;;     2) Your initialization file, `.emacs' (this file).
;;     3) A site library, `default.el', if there is one.  You can
;;        inhibit this by setting variable `inhibit-default-init' to
;;        non-nil.
;;
;;  2. The variable `load-path' determines the order of searching
;;     libraries for files to load.  If you want to load your own file
;;     in place of a file having the same name in another library,
;;     then its directory should come before the other library in the
;;     list `load-path'.  If you want to make sure another library is
;;     already loaded when you load a file, then that file should
;;     require or load it as follows: (require 'library) or
;;     (load-library "library").
;;
;;  3. Before changing anything, check what existing settings do.  To
;;     know what a variable is/does, place the cursor on its name and
;;     type `C-h v'.  To know what a command or other function does,
;;     place the cursor on its name and type `C-h f'.
;;
;;  4. SETTING VARIABLES - You can use `defvar' to
;;     set a variable *before* loading a library that might also set
;;     it with `defvar': (defvar some-var some-value).  Only the first
;;     `defvar' executed assigns a value to the variable.  You can use
;;     `defconst' or `setq' to set a variable unconditionally: (setq
;;     some-var some-value) or (defconst some-var some-value).  Each
;;     call to one of these functions assigns a new value.  Try using
;;     `defvar' first to customize things; resort to `defconst' only
;;     if `defvar' doesn't seem to have any effect (either because a
;;     previous `defvar' was done or a subsequent `setq' or `defconst'
;;     was done).  Some variables have different (local) values in
;;     different buffers.  To set a variable's default (global) value
;;     for all buffers, use `setq-default': (setq some-var
;;     default-value).  An alternative to using `defvar' is using the
;;     menubar `Help > Customize' menu (this automatically modifies
;;     your Emacs init file).
;;
;;  5. See the Emacs manual, section `Customization' (especially
;;     subsection `Customization') for more information on customizing
;;     Emacs, including examples: `C-h i'; choose `Emacs'; choose
;;     `Customization' in the main menu, under heading `Advanced
;;     Features'; choose node
;;    `Init File'.
;;
;;  6. On Unix, you can predefine certain aspects of the display via
;;     the file `.Xdefaults' in your home director (`~').  Here is one
;;     suggestion (add these or similar lines to `~/.Xdefaults'):
;;
;;       emacs.Background:   LightBlue
;;       emacs.Foreground:   Black
;;       emacs.cursorColor:  Red
;;       emacs.pointerColor: Red
;;
;;       Emacs*popup.font: -*-*-*-*-*-21-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
;;       Emacs*menubar.font: -*-*-*-*-*-21-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
;;       Emacs*popup.background: Pink
;;       Emacs*menubar.background: Pink
;;       Emacs*menubar.buttonForeground: Blue
;;
;;     For more information on the `.Xdefaults' file, see the Emacs
;;     manual (`C-h i'), node `Resources X'.

;;
;;  HELP WITH EMACS
;;
;;  This section provides general info on using Emacs.  For more info,
;;  type `Control-h i' in Emacs to consult the Emacs user manual.
;;
;;  NOTATION - In Emacs documentation, "C-" means (press and hold) the
;;  Control key; "M-" means the Alt key (called "Meta"); "DEL" means
;;  the Backspace key; "RET" means the Return or Enter key; "SPC"
;;  means the space bar, "ESC" means the Escape key.  A combination
;;  like "C-M-" (or "M-C") means press and hold both Control and Meta
;;  keys.
;;
;;  ABORTING - You can use `C-g' to abort any action you have
;;  started.  For some actions, you may need to repeat this.  If even
;;  this doesn't clear things up entirely, then try `C-]', which
;;  should do the trick.
;;
;;  HELP - For help with Emacs, use the `Help' menu, submenu
;;  `Describe'.  Item `This...'  in this menu (shortcut: `C-h RET')
;;  combines many of the other items into one.  It lets you
;;  mouse-click anything, type keys, or choose a menu item to get help
;;  on the object clicked, the keys typed, or the menu item chosen.
;;
;;  Some of the menus and key bindings used here are different from
;;  those described in the standard Emacs manual, which is available
;;  via the `Help' menu, item `Info' (shortcut: `C-h i'), `Emacs'.
;;  All other documentary help should be up-to-date and accurate.
;;
;;  COMMANDS - You can enter any command, whether bound to a key
;;  sequence or not, via `M-x'.  Previously entered commands are
;;  available for editing and re-execution via `C-p' (previous) and
;;  `C-n' (next).  See also `C-x ESC ESC' for more advanced command
;;  editing.
;;
;;  INPUT - Some actions require you to input some text in the
;;  "minibuffer" (where you enter commands).  Default text (usually
;;  the text surrounding the cursor) may already be provided there,
;;  for possible modification.  You can remove this quickly, if you
;;  like, via `M-C-DEL' or `C-x DEL'.  Use `RET' to confirm and enter
;;  the input you want.
;;
;;    For example, the command `grep' (menu `Search', item 'Grep', or
;;    just `M-x grep') expects you to input text to search for, and
;;    file name patterns for files to search.  By default, this
;;    command puts the text found around the cursor into the
;;    minibuffer as the text to look for.  If that's not what you
;;    want, type `M-C-DEL' (or just repeated `DEL's) to remove it,
;;    then type the text and file name patterns you want and confirm
;;    with `RET'.
;;
;;
;;  EMACS JARGON
;;
;;  Here is a translation to/from Emacs-speak:
;;
;;         common term       Emacs term
;;         -----------       ----------
;;         selection         region
;;         cut               kill
;;         paste             yank
;;         window            frame
;;
;;  The (text) "cursor" is the place where you insert typed text; it
;;  is rectangular, by default.  The (mouse) "pointer" shows the mouse
;;  position; it is an arrow, by default.  The terms "point" and
;;  "mark" are discussed below.
;;
;;  In Emacs terms, a "window" is a frame pane, that is, a sub-frame.
;;  The "mode-line" is the text at the bottom border of a window.
;;
;;  The "minibuffer" is the special buffer for entering commands.  If
;;  you use my library `oneonone.el' and option
;;  `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil, then the minibuffer
;;  appears as a separate frame.  Otherwise, it the minibuffer
;;  typically appears at the bottom of each frame.
;;
;;
;;  BUFFER MODES
;;
;;  Each buffer has its own editing mode (key bindings etc).
;;  Information on a buffer's current mode is available via the `Help'
;;  menu, item `Describe Mode' (shortcuts: `C-h m' or `C-h RET' click
;;  buffer).  In the menu bar, all menus to the left of the separator
;;  `||' are specific to the current mode; the menus to the right
;;  (`Buffers', `Files', `Tools', `Edit', `Search', `Frames', `Help')
;;  are common to all modes.  (See also `M-x describe-menubar'.)
;;
;;
;;  UNDO
;;
;;  You can undo anything via the `Edit' menu, item `Undo'
;;  (shortcut:`C-/').  This can be repeated any number of times.  Do
;;  anything else to stop undoing.  Doing undo after that redoes what
;;  you undid (because it undoes the undoing!).  You can tell when
;;  you've undone all unsaved changes, because the lower left of the
;;  mode line shows `--' instead of `**'.  You can quickly undo all
;;  unsaved changes via `M-x revert-buffer'.
;;
;;
;;  MOUSE
;;
;;  You can use the mouse as usual: press MB1 (left mouse button) and
;;  drag to define the selection, MB2 (center mouse button) to paste.
;;  MB3 (right mouse button) extends the selection (twice=kills it) or
;;  pops up a context-appropriate menu, depending on the current
;;  buffer.  Check the Emacs manual to learn about additional
;;  available mouse actions.  In particular, a secondary selection is
;;  also available by pressing and holding the Meta key (or `M-C-')
;;  during mouse actions.  For example, press and hold `M-' while
;;  dragging the mouse to define the secondary selection; press and
;;  hold `M-' and click MB2 to paste it.  It's quite useful to have
;;  two separate selections to paste etc.
;;
;;
;;  SEARCH / REPLACE
;;
;;  You can use the `Search' menu for this.  However, incremental
;;  searching is generally better to use (more convenient and more
;;  powerful).  It is available via `C-s' and `C-r'; for more
;;  information, type `C-s C-h'.  Other search options are available,
;;  including regular expression (wildcard) searches and searching
;;  (`M-x grep') or replacing (`Q' in Dired) in multiple files.
;;
;;
;;  REGION (SELECTION)
;;
;;  The text cursor (not the mouse pointer) defines the position of
;;  the "point", which is one end of the region.  The other end is the
;;  "mark" position.  You can set the point by clicking MB1 or using
;;  the arrow keys.  You can set the mark in any of these ways:
;;
;;     - `C-SPC' (point stays where it was)
;;     - dragging the point with MB1 (old point becomes the mark)
;;     - clicking MB3 (becomes the point; old point becomes the mark)
;;
;;  If you define the region without using the mouse, it may be
;;  invisible; you can make it visible via `C-x C-x', which also swaps
;;  the point and the mark.
;;
;;
;;  FRAME COMMANDS
;;
;;  Use the `Frames' menu to manipulate frames.
;;
;;    `Resize This Frame' (`C-x C-_') resizes the current frame to try
;;                 to fit all the text of the current window.
;;
;;    `Hide Frames / Show Buffers' (`M-C-z') hides all of
;;                 the frames except one, which is then iconified.
;;                 This is especially useful with Microsoft Windows
;;                 prior to XP, because, unlike `Iconify All Frames'
;;                 (see next), it places only a single icon in the
;;                 task bar.
;;
;;                 Memorize the binding of this command: `M-C-z'; you
;;                 use it again to reverse the action.  After hiding
;;                 everything, when you click the single icon it opens
;;                 a single frame (which may not have a menu bar).
;;                 You then type `M-c-z' to get access to the other
;;                 frames (via the displayed Buffer List).
;;
;;                 An alternative shortcut for this command is
;;                 `[C-mouse-1]' in the minibuffer; that is, clicking
;;                 mouse-1 in the minibuffer while pressing the
;;                 CONTROL key.
;;
;;    `Iconify All Frames' iconifies each frame separately.
;;
;;    `Tile Frames Horizontally', `Tile Frames Vertically' do what
;;                 they say.  Use them, for example, before comparing
;;                 buffers using `Tools > Compare'.
;;
;;  Use the `Buffers' menu to raise individual frames (and buffers).
;;  Use the `Files' menu to delete, duplicate and split frames.
