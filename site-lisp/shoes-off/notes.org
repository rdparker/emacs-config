* remote call to the bouncer emacs to setup the session
** need some sort of listener
*** could be just emacs daemon stuff tho?
*** or elnode?
* established irc session
** hook into data arrival
** send to bouncer log
* so the job is managing the client connection and the bouncer log
** recieve a connection
*** attach the actual rcirc buffer to it
*** when stuff arrives in the irc buffer send it back to the socket
*** when stuff arrives on the socket send it to the irc buffer

* from forcer
20:55 <forcer> nicferrier: You need to interpret PING (to stay
               alive), JOIN/PART/KICK (to tell a connecting client
               which channels they are on), and QUIT (to
               reconnect). You might want to interpret PRIVMSG and
               possibly other messages to keep a log and give a
               connecting client a backlog.
20:55 *** c0rn_ JOIN

20:55 <forcer> (That was from the top of my head, I might have
missed something important)

* connect to bouncer from rcirc
** connect is
*** pass
*** nick
*** user
** we want pass and user to validate?
*** nick does not matter
** you already have the rcirc config you need tied to the user?
** you already have an established rcirc session tied to the user

* when we connect from the bouncer to the upstream irc
** we need to store these responses for reply
*** 002 - yourhost
*** 003 - created (when the server was created)
*** 004 - myinfo
*** 005 - bounce (info on where to make alternative connections)
