These are backports of various packages to earlier Emacsen.

This directory should appear late in `load-path' after all of Emac's
standard lisp and site-lisp directories.  That way if a package comes
with the running Emacs, it will be used instead of these packages,
which should only be used when there is no version shipped with Emacs.
