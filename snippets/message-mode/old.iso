We offer a downloadable ISO version of the installer (which you can burn to
CD/DVD), for a single platform, with a 10-seat developer license, for \$499.
The same ISO plus updates for all versions of Boost released within the
following 12-month period is \$999.

A platform is defined to be a compiler toolchain, OS version, and instruction
set architecture triple.

Thank you,
