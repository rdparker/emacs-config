When people flooded EmacsChannel with code or debug messages instead of using
[[lisppaste]], pjb mentioned his function `erc-yank', which is part of
[http://darcs.informatimago.com/local/darcs/public/emacs/pjb-erc.el pjb-erc.el].

`erc-yank' automatically adds pastes to http://paste.lisp.org/ if the text
you want to yank is more than a certain number of lines long.

Note that you'll need to use some of his personal libraries, available
at http://darcs.informatimago.com/darcs/public/emacs/.  [[w3]] is required as
well.

This file seems to have been developed using a somewhat older version of
ERC than the latest release (it requires `erc-nets' which was renamed
`erc-networks').  Changing the ##(require 'erc-nets)## to 
##(require 'erc-networks)## and ##(require 'erc-nickserv)## to
##(require 'erc-services)## should fix that.

I wrote a different, much simpler (16 line function) version of this that uses
