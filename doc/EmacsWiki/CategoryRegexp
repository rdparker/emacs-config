This category is about regular expressions.  See also CategorySearchAndReplace.


== Understanding Regular Expressions ==

* RegularExpression -- what are regular expressions, anyway?
* RegularExpressionHelp -- typical errors and frequently asked questions
* RegexpReferences -- where to look for more information
* CaseFoldSearch -- controlling case sensitivity when searching
* MultilineRegexp -- how to match multiline content
* NonAsciiRegexps -- dealing with non-ASCII characters
* NonGreedyRegexp -- how to write <code>.*?</code> in old emacsen

== Using Regular Expressions Interactively ==

* '''[[IncrementalSearch#RegexpSearches]]''' -- Using regexps with Isearch -- a good way to ''learn to use'' regexps
* [[Icicles]] -- Another good way to ''learn to use'' regexps -- lots of different uses, including:
** [[Completion]] and cycling of completion candidates through regexp matching
** a new kind of incremental search: use multiple simple regexps, instead of struggling with a complex regexp; and regexp subgroups are highlighted individually
* GrepMode -- `M-x grep' searches files for matches
* OccurBuffer -- `M-x occur' works on buffers like `M-x grep' does on files
* SearchBuffers -- Search *all* buffers
* SearchAndReplaceDelimitedStrings -- Replace the prefix and suffix of a pattern while leaving the middle alone
* GrepList -- search a list of strings for a regexp, recursing into sublists
* OverlappingRegexps -- overlap regular expressions in a replace command
* RecursiveGrep -- various commands that recursively search a file system



== Programming with Regular Expressions ==

* ReBuilder -- build a regexp string and watch what it matches as you type
* Regex-tool -- similar to ReBuilder, found at http://github.com/jwiegley/regex-tool. See article [[http://www.newartisans.com/2007/10/a-regular-expression-ide-for-emacs.html|A regular expression IDE for Emacs]] by JohnWiegley 
* SymbolicRegexp -- for programmers who want to write readable regular expressions
* [[rx]] -- macro that generates regexps from SymbolicRegexp
